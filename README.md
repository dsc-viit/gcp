Google has launched its flagship program called 30 Days with Google Cloud to be held in the month of October. 🎉

This program is the very first quest (guided training) by DSC which will provide engineering students with an opportunity to kickstart their learning on cloud technology using practice on Google Cloud which is the tool that powers apps like Google Search, Gmail and YouTube.

Upon successful completion of the program, you'll get Google Cloud Goodies and Digital Badges from Google itself! 🤩

Dedicate a few hours every day, learn at your own pace and complete at least one track in 30 days (up to 𝟑𝟏𝐬𝐭 𝐎𝐜𝐭 𝟐𝟎𝟐𝟎) to avail prizes like Certificate(s), T-Shirt(s), Sticker Packs and Laptop Bag( Only for those who will complete 2 tracks ) from Google itself.

As part of the program, there are two tracks
1. Cloud Engineering Track
2. Data Science & Machine Learning Track

Completing either of the track will earn you a certificate of participation from Google, Google Cloud branded T-Shirts and stickers.

If you complete both, hurray!!! You'll get many more exciting prices.

So, what are you waiting for?

Student progress tracking:

1. If the student is already enrolled in #GoogleCloudReady Facilitator program as a participant, he/she will not be eligible for the prizes as this program is quite similar to 30 Days of Google Cloud program and his/her progress will not be tracked under you. However, the student can still enrol in the program and get Qwiklabs credits for practice. We strongly recommend sharing this update to the channels which you shared before.

2. For rest students, the progress tracking will be as per the usual scenario if they are not enrolled in #GoogleCloudReady Facilitator program or might have already completed 1-2 quests earlier which are not part of the tracks mentioned.
